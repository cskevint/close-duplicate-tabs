# Close Duplicate Tabs

## Overview

"Close Duplicate Tabs" is a Chrome extension that helps you manage your browser tabs by automatically closing duplicate tabs. The extension treats URLs that only differ by the fragment (the part after the `#` symbol) as the same.

## Features

- Automatically closes duplicate tabs.
- Treats URLs with different fragments as duplicates.
- Lightweight and easy to use.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cskevint/close-duplicate-tabs.git
    ```
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the cloned repository folder.

## Usage

Once installed, the extension will automatically close any duplicate tabs that you open. You don't need to do anything manually.
